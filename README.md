Inspiration
	Communication is essential in many contexts, and one of the beautiful things about it is the many methods that humans, animals, and even cells use to communicate. Our project was inspired by how AI and machine learning can aid education and communication. Sign language is an incredibly useful tool used by more than 72 million people worldwide (National Geographic, 2023). We were inspired by other learning apps and tools to create a similar model using AI to aid in teaching and translating sign language in real time using the AI software. There are many ways to learn new languages, but our project’s goal was to make it as interactive and engaging as possible to encourage more people to gain a basic grasp of sign language to create a more inclusive and understanding society. We also decided on a chimp mascot since chimpanzees and gorillas are the only animals other than humans to understand sign language.

Project Purpose
	SignChimp teaches ASL and hopefully other popular forms of sign language to the general public through different games, lessons, and life feedback. While such ideas are popular, we aimed to branch out to capture various study techniques, such as retrieval practice, and encourage regularity with the program for steady progress. We created our front-end portion with the goal of making the site as accessible and beginner-friendly as possible. We hope to promote a societal value for life-long learning by creating easy and encouraging learning tools. 

Build Process

Challenges we Faced 
	One of the challenges we faced was collecting data for our AI software during the hackathon period. Variations in hand positioning and backgrounds were particularly finicky, and we didn’t have time to collect more examples of different lighting or gestures. In real-world implementation, it would take a much larger pool of data to make this tool accessible and inclusive, as a wide range of signing abilities and environmental factors affected Matlab’s ability to detect hand signs. We would also have to consult with a broader audience to gain feedback for creating truly helpful software that can be utilized by people from various backgrounds.

What we Learned

Future SignChimp Plans
	In the future, we hope to expand the lessons beyond the alphabet and integrate more memory games and learning tools to encourage people from a wide range of ages to be interested in utilizing SignChimp. We would also love to implement a sort of schedule feature that is a bit similar to other language learning apps to help members with accountability in their learning journeys.
